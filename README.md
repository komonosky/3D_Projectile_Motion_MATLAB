# 3D_Projectile_Motion_MATLAB
A 3D projectile motion physics game written in MATLAB

This was the semester project for a class I took called Linear Systems, which was about modelling dynamic systems using mathematical techniques such as linear algebra and  differential equations. The goal of the project was to recreate the popular mobile game "Angry Birds" in MATLAB. The program incorporates the effects of air drag, projectile size and weight, and magnetic force. I was the only one in the class who managed to implement it in 3-D. I also added the ability for the projectile to bounce off the walls and ceiling.

The colored squares act as magnets, and push or pull on the projectile. This is pretty cool, as it is possible to curve the projectile.

To play:
 - Download the file and run it
 - The program will prompt the user for various settings, such as difficulty (magnet strength) and projectile size and weight
 - After making all selections, the projectile will launch
 - Points are scored based on how close the projectile gets to the red box (target)

REQUIREMENTS
 - You will need some version of MATLAB. I believe this was written using R2021a, but older/newer versions should work fine
