# 3D_Projectile_Motion_MATLAB
A 3D projectile motion physics game written in MATLAB

This was the semester project for a class I took called Linear Systems, which was about modelling dynamic systems using mathematical techniques such as linear algebra and  differential equations. The goal of the project was to recreate the popular mobile game "Angry Birds" in MATLAB. The program incorporates the effects of air drag, projectile size and weight, and magnetic force. The requirements stated 2-D, but I managed to implement it in 3-D. I also added the ability for the projectile to bounce off the walls and ceiling.
